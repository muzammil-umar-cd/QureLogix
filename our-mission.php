            <h4><span class="bolded">Building Relationships</span></h4>

            <p>We focus on creating connections with authors and each other. Each book is as unique as the author who
                wrote it. We work
                one-on-one with each author or publisher and adapt to their needs during their book printing journey.
            </p>

            <div class="vspace-1em auto-width"></div>

            <h4><span class="bolded">Innovating</span></h4>

            <p>It is exciting and challenging to be in the book printing industry because it is always evolving. By
                perpetually learning,
                expanding our expertise, and constantly changing, we are able to be the experts that clients need.</p>

            <div class="vspace-1em auto-width"></div>

            <h4><span class="bolded">Taking Ownership</span></h4>

            <p>We enjoy creating tangible objects that reflect the efforts that we and the authors have put into making.
                We offer a wide
                range of books options and features so that each book can be customized to the author or publisher's
                desire. As a company
                and as individuals, we take responsibility and pride for our work and make ethical decisions.</p>

            <div id="affordable-anchor" class="anchor"></div>
            <h2 class="fontsize-200 text-center">Affordable Book Printing</h2>

            <p>As a short-run book printer, we are able to print books in smaller quantities than most offset printers
                can. To print a
                book, you can start with printing as little as 25 books or go all the way up to 5,000 books at a time.
                Plus, for every
                additional book you print, your cost per book goes down! So, whether you need 25 books to share with
                friends and family or
                5,000 books to launch your self-published novel, we'll ensure that your books meet our highest standard
                of quality.</p>

                    genres</a>. Since we
                are not a publisher, we do not curate content and believe in giving complete control to the authors who
                write them. We believe
                every book is special as the author who writes them. Our experienced team has printed a wide variety of

                adventure novels to advanced reader copies; from art and photography books to biographies; and from
                cookbooks to coursebooks.
                We've printed essays, fantasy novels, graphic novels, health and fitness books, history books, hobby and
                game books, humor
                books, journals, manuals, memoirs, mysteries, political books, religious and spirituality books, romance
                novels, science

            <p>The right book design and the best book printing options can make all the difference to your book’s
                success. While people
                shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, its appearance can determine if it gets picked off the shelf.
                That's why we offer various
                customization options for your book.</p>

            <p>You can choose from our three binding options - <a
                    href="javascript:;">softcover</a>,
                <a href="javascript:;">hardcover</a>, or
                <a href="javascript:;">spiral-bound</a>. Our softcover binding option is
                ideal for almost all books,
                while our hardcover binding option offers maximum durability and sophisticated appearance. Our
                spiral-bound option is perfect for
                workbooks, manuals, and other reference materials that need to lay flat.
            </p>

            <p>Our <a href="javascript:;">high-quality book paper</a> and materials come in numerous
                weights and colors, allowing
                you to create a distinctive book that reflects your vision. We use the highest quality book paper for
                the interior that is smooth,
                easy to handle and better quality than most mass-produced paperback books making your book stand out and
                enjoyable to read.</p>

            <p>We offer a range of <a href="javascript:;"> Premium Add-ons</a>, such as 3D
                spot UV, interior foldouts,

                book design and prepare your
                book for printing. Unlike some book printers that require you to use specific softwares, we understand

            <p>Instead of going to a traditional book publisher, you could be your own publisher and keep 100% control
                of your book and 100% of
                the profits. Self-publishing is becoming more popular than traditional publishing because of how easy it
                is to do! Simply by
                printing your own book with a book printer instead of a publisher, you are getting your book published
                and being your own publisher.
                <?php echo WEBSITE_NAME; ?> has printed millions of books for self-published authors and small-publishers. We are
                here to help you!</p>
